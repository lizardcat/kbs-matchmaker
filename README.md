## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration & Issue Tracking
We will use GitHub's **Issues** feature to propose ideas and track improvements for the system:
1. If you have a suggestion or find a bug, go to the **Issues** tab on GitHub and create a new issue.
2. Describe the issue or feature request clearly.
3. Team members can review issues and assign themselves tasks to work on.
4. Once a solution is ready, open a pull request for review before merging changes.

## ðŸ”„ Using Branches to Implement Changes
To ensure safe collaboration, always use feature branches before pushing changes to the main branch:
1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Implemented new matchmaking rule"
   ```
3. Push the branch to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
4. Open a pull request (PR) for review.
5. After approval, merge the branch into `main` and delete the feature branch.

This workflow ensures that changes are reviewed and tested before being merged into the main project.
